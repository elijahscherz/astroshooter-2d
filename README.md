# astroshooter-2d

Unity2D using C# -- space shooter.

Super huge thanks to [Kenney](http://www.kenney.nl/) for the amazing art assets that he put out for free use. It makes game programming and design a much quicker process.

## Directions This Game is Taking
- Customizable ships. You get score, then that is converted to galactic credits. Those credits are used to buy upgrades for powerups, your ship, and other aspects of the game.
- Standard ships that can be used.
- More enemies, with AI. Specifically the already implemented Saucers.
- Pickup Powerups (CHECK!)
- An powerup system based on the current score? Trade in score to last longer?
- A difficulty system based on the score and time played.
- Movement system based on mouse input. (Based on upgrades.)

## Coming Soon
- Highscore tracking and saving. (CHECK!)
- Main Menu
- Consistent UI elements, regarding position on screen.

## Recently Implemented
- Cool Powerups
- Highscore Saving
- Shield Animations
