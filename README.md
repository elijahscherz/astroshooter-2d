# astroshooter-2d

Unity2D using C# -- space shooter.

Super huge thanks to [Kenney](http://www.kenney.nl/) for the amazing art assets that he put out for free use. It makes game programming and design a much quicker process.

If you want to try the most recent build of the game, go to `Demos`, choose your operating system. All the packages are 32-bit. Unzip the package, and run the application. With regard to Windows or Linux builds, the `_Data` file is essential for building the game. Make sure that they are stored in the same location and they should be found fine. (In a folder called "Astroshooter".)

## Directions This Game is Taking
- Customizable ships. You get score, then that is converted to galactic credits. Those credits are used to buy upgrades for powerups, your ship, and other aspects of the game.
- Standard ships that can be used.
- More enemies, with AI. Specifically the already implemented Saucers.
- An powerup system based on the current score? Trade in score to last longer?
- A difficulty system based on the score and time played.
- Movement system based on mouse input. (Based on upgrades.)

## Coming Soon
- Main Menu (semi-CHECK!)
- Default ships to choose from.

## Recently Implemented
- Consistent UI
