# Astroshooter To-do / Tasklist

## Coding | Programming
- Spaceship upgrading, standard spaceships to choose from. (Differences based on size, mass, speed, etc.)
- Highscore, with saving ability.
- Input: based on mouse, rotating the player to that input, allowing for shooting with mouse?
- Bonus stages where you have to navigate through a moving asteroid field?

## Visuals | Graphics
- Main Menu
- Consolidating UI elements into the canvas, or a similar system.
Change `livesText` to something more visual like mini-spaceships. (Nod to Pacman.)
