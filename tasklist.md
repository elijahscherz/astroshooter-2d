# Astroshooter To-do / Tasklist

## Coding | Programming
- Spaceship upgrading.
- Standard spaceships to choose from. (Differences based on size, mass, speed, etc.)
- Implement a health system as opposed to the current one life per damage.
- Change the shielding system so when you pick up an upgrade when already shielded it shields you again. Also change the way the shield times are kept track of so they can be adjusted depending on ship type.
- Input: based on mouse, rotating the player to that input, allowing for shooting with mouse?
- Bonus stages where you have to navigate through a moving asteroid field?
- Multiplayer support?:)

## Visuals | Graphics
