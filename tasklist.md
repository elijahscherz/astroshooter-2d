# Astroshooter To-do / Tasklist

## Coding | Programming
- Spaceship upgrading. Separate scenes to switch from, Main Menu, Ship Editor?, Game, etc.
- Standard spaceships to choose from. (Differences based on size, mass, speed, etc.)
- Input: based on mouse, rotating the player to that input, allowing for shooting with mouse?
- Bonus stages where you have to navigate through a moving asteroid field?
- Multiplayer support?:)

## Visuals | Graphics
- Main Menu
- Visual Ship Editor?
- Change `livesText` to something more visual like mini-spaceships. (Nod to Pacman.)
